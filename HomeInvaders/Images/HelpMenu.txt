                                          COMBAT:
            A   »  »  »   Attack   »  »  »   Deliver a 1 damage attack but use 1 stamina

            B   »  »  »   Block    »  »  »   Raise your shield to negate any damage

            R   »  »  »   Rest     »  »  »   Take a rest that adds 1 to both health and stamina 

                                       COMBAT TIPS:
 -If you and the enemy both attack each other at the same time, both combatants will take damage. 
										
 -If an attack is made while the other combatant is resting, a critical hit will take place which
  causes double damage. Choose your Rests carefully.

 -Keep an eye on your stamina. Every time you attack you will use stamina and if you run out you
  will be unable to attack until you have rested.
