# home-invaders
This is a game called "Home Invaders" that I came up with to help me learn how to code in C#. 

The premise of the game is simple: 
You are a hero who has been tasked with clearing out a house full of unruly goblins (the home invaders). You will need to first kill the small goblins hanging out in the house, which will then reveal the goblin king. Once the king is located, you must execute the king to stop the goblins. 

See the Help page (on the main menu) to learn how to play. 

This is my C# project ever so I'd love to hear your feedback and where I have room to improve. 

Thanks for checking out Home Invaders!
